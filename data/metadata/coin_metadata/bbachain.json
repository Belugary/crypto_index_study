    "en": "BBAChain is a Layer 1 blockchain platform launched on October 21st, 2023 by BTI Group OÜ a company based in Estonia, designed to optimize the functionality, scalability, and affordability of decentralized applications. It utilizes a hybrid consensus mechanism that combines Proof of Stake (PoS), Proof of History (PoH), Derive of Half, and the Algorithm of Dichotomy. This innovative approach allows BBAChain to process transactions at a rate of 100,000 per second for just a few cents.\r\n\r\nBBA is the native utility token used within the BBAChain ecosystem for: \r\n\r\n• Fees for processing transactions and maintaining data. \r\n• Staking by validators to participate in the network consensus and earn rewards. \r\n• Engaging in network governance decisions.\r\n\r\nBBAChain is building a native ecosystem that includes key features such as: \r\n\r\n• A decentralized exchange (DEX) for seamless peer-to-peer asset trading. \r\n• A euro-pegged stablecoin, facilitating stable digital transactions. \r\n• An NFT marketplace that supports the minting, trading, and auctioning of digital collectibles. \r\n• A comprehensive DeFi ecosystem that offers various financial services. \r\n• A decentralized network that will facilitate government and institutions to run national elections, voting and polls through the blockchain."
