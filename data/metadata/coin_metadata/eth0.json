    "en": "ETH0 is a synthetic ETH asset fully backed by Lido’s wstETH and issued by the Usual protocol. It allows institutional investors and crypto-native whales to maintain directional ETH exposure while capturing significantly higher yields than conventional staking or restaking.\r\n\r\nPowered by the same architecture that underpins Usual’s stablecoin (backed by tokenized T-bills), ETH0 holders receive USUAL tokens, allowing them to outperform the underlying yield.\r\n\r\nFor hedge funds, treasuries, and whales seeking to make ETH work harder, ETH0 offers a liquid, composable, and yield-optimized vehicle."
