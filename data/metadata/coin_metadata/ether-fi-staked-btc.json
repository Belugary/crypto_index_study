    "en": "eBTC is ether.fi's flagship Bitcoin-backed liquid restaking token. Created to service the growing demands for alternative collateral within restaking, eBTC simplifies yield optimization and expands utility. \r\n\r\nIt is backed by LBTC through a partnership with Lombard, bringing the first dual-yielding (staking and restaking) Bitcoin product to the market. Staking is conducted through Babylon, with restaking services provided by a combination of Eigen Layer, Symbiotic, and Karak. Users are able to deposit LBTC and WBTC."
