    "en": "|The Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) Alliance is the world’s largest open-source initiative dedicated to decentralized Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Formed in April 2024, the ASI Alliance unites SingularityNET, Fetch.ai, and Ocean Protocol, with CUDOS joining as a network member shortly after. The ASI Alliance was established through a community-approved tokenomic merger—combining $AGIX, $FET, and $OCEAN into a single token: $FET. This unified token underpins a collaborative framework designed to scale open-source AI and stand as the largest open-sourced, independent entity in AI research and development. The Alliance is committed to accelerating the advancement of decentralized Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and, ultimately, Artificial Superintelligence (ASI). It provides a robust, open-source innovation stack, empowering developers, enterprises, and researchers globally to build ethical, scalable, and groundbreaking AI solutions. This ensures that advanced intelligence remains a shared, accessible resource, fostering innovation beyond centralized systems and promoting a future where AI benefits all."
