    "en": "Fuzzybear ($FUZZY) is a memecoin on the XRP Ledger (XRPL), created to honor the legacy of the well-known XRPL address ‘Fuzzybear,’ which famously placed a DEX order in 2014: 1 XRP for 1 BTC. The token embodies the spirit of decentralization and community-driven growth, focusing on fun, engagement, and organic expansion. With its unique narrative and strong community, Fuzzybear grows naturally as more supporters join the movement."
