    "en": "Kamino Finance was originally created to offer users the easiest possible way of providing liquidity and earning yield on-chain.\r\n\r\nThe protocol's one-click, auto-compounding concentrated liquidity strategies quickly became the most popular LP products on Solana, and laid the foundation for what Kamino is now.\r\n\r\nToday, Kamino is a first-of-its-kind DeFi protocol that unifies Lending, Liquidity, and Leverage into a single, secure DeFi product suite."
