    "en": "Magic Internet Money (MIM) is the first mainstream Bitcoin meme, originally created in 2013 and deployed a decade later on the Bitcoin blockchain by its original artist, Mavensbot.\r\n\r\nIt all began in the r/bitcoin subreddit, where Mavensbot posted his now-iconic MS Paint artwork of the “Magic Internet Money Wizard”. His drawing was later turned into a reddit ad to promote Bitcoin. It then became the most successful Reddit ad of all time and played a key role in Bitcoin’s early rise from $27 to $1,132, while helping grow the r/bitcoin subreddit community from 10,000 to over 100,000 subscribers by the end of 2014.  "
