    "en": "Moonwell Artemis uses battle tested code from the Moonwell Apollo protocol to provide an open, non-custodial lending and borrowing DeFi protocol. While Apollo is a community driven protocol with innovative features, Artemis users will enjoy polished features with faster transaction times, while still preserving the same level of security.\r\n\r\nMoonwellâ€™s goal is to be the most user-friendly, fast, and secure DeFi protocol in the ecosystem. With this in mind, an emphasis was placed on having a high standard of security. Multi-signature systems are implemented for all smart contracts used by the protocol, with the expert cyber-security team at Halborn Security auditing all contracts before deployment. Additionally, there is a generous bounty program through a partnership with the trusted team at ImmuneFi, which allows security researchers to submit their findings for review and earn a bounty for discovering security vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\n"
