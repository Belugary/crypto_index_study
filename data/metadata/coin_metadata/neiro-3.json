    "en": "Neiro is an ERC-20 token deployed on Ethereum. It is a memecoin dedicated to the newly-adopted Shiba Inu dog from the woman who previously owned the famous Kabosu, face of the Doge meme.\r\n\r\nAfter being rugged by its developer, a powerful community has come together to support this legendary dog. Neiro is 100% owned and by a community of hard-working and passionate holders.\r\n\r\nNeiro is a meme coin with no intrinsic value or expectation of financial return. There is no formal team or roadmap. the coin is completely useless and for entertainment purposes only."
