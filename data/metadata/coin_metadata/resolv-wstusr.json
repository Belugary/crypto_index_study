    "en": "What is Resolv?\r\nResolv is a protocol maintaining USR, a stablecoin natively backed by Ether (ETH) and pegged to US Dollar.\r\n\r\nThe protocol's main features include:\r\n\r\nIssuance and redemption of USR against other tokens;\r\n\r\nMaintaining sufficent backing by ETH at all times. This is achieved by hedging ETH price with short perpetual futures positions;\r\n\r\nMaintaining RLP (Resolv Liquidity Pool), a liquid insurance pool designed to keep USR overcollateralized.\r\n\r\nBoth USR and RLP can be minted and redeemed by users in exchange for collateral deposited on 1:1 basis."
