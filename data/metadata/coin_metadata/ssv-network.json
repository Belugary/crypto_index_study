    "en": "SSV promotes decentralization, security, and liveness across the Ethereum consensus layer and forms the foundation of SSV.network â€“ a fully decentralized and robust ETH staking network. Using the network will be open and simple for anyone who wants to run an Ethereum validator; from DIY users all the way to staking pools and big institutional staking services. This applies to using the network both as a user or a service provider; regardless of staking configuration, as long as duties are properly executed, anyone is eligible to provide service and reap rewards for doing so.
