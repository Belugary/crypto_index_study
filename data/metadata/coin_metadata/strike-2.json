    "en": "Strike Finance introduces options, forwards, and perpetual futures trading directly on the Cardano blockchain.\r\n\r\nCurrently, centralized exchanges account for more than 98% of derivatives trading in crypto assets. Derivatives trading on Cardano are nearly non-existent before the advent of Strike Finance. This scarcity is not due to a lack of demand for on-chain trading, but rather the absence of a derivatives protocol.\r\n\r\nOptions, forwards, and perpetual futures trading offer traders a wider range of tools to capitalize on the volatile crypto market. Strike Finance streamlines this process by providing a beginner-friendly trading experience. Our platform empowers individuals with advanced financial instruments while maintaining the security and transparency inherent to blockchain technology."
