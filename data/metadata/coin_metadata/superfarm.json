This wide array of Web3 tools and features is supported and governed by a single protocol and token: $SUPER ERC20 (formerly known as SuperFarm).\r\n\r\nThe SuperVerse harbors two central products: GigaMart, a next-gen NFT marketplace with advanced analytics tools and unique social features, and Impostors, a social-gaming metaverse.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat makes them unique?\r\n\r\nBy creating fun and inclusive games that appeal to modern gaming culture, the SuperVerse aims to overcome the current limitations of the Web3 space and take blockchain technology and NFTs mainstream.
